JetBot is an open-source robot based on NVIDIA Jetson Nano that is

* **Affordable** - Less than $150 add-on to Jetson Nano
* **Educational** - Tutorials from basic motion to AI based collision avoidance
* **Fun!** - Interactively programmed from your web browser

Building and using JetBot gives the hands on experience needed to create entirely new AI projects.

To get started, read the [JetBot Wiki](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot/wiki).


This project is based on jetbot and try to turn it into a bigger bot with the same capabilities. The main modification is the drive-train being changed for a 10" (or less) hoverboard.
The python library to drive the hoverboard is :
